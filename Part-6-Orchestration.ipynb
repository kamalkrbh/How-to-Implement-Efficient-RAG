    "### Topic A: Caching - \"The fastest query is the one you don't make\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** \n",
    "- Every request costs time and money\n",
    "- Many users ask similar questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: Response Caching**\n",
    "```\n",
    "First Request \"How to Implement RAG based AI app?\":\n",
    "  User → Query Normalization → Cache MISS → \n",
    "  Retriever (200ms) → LLM (2000ms) → Response (2.2s)\n",

    "  User → Query Normalization → Cache HIT → \n",
    "  Return cached response (10ms) 📉 220x faster!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "1. **Query Normalization**: Normalize case, whitespace, punctuation\n",
    "   - `\"How to Implement RAG based AI app?\"` = `\"how to implement rag based ai app?\"` (normalize)\n",
    "2. **Cache Key**: Hash of normalized query + Tenant-ID\n",
    "   - Prevents cross-tenant data leaks\n",
    "   - Format: `rag:v1:{tenant}:{query_hash}`\n",
    "3. **TTL (Time-To-Live)**: 15 minutes (900 seconds)\n",
    "   - Balance between freshness and cache efficiency\n",
    "4. **Tools**: Redis, Memcached, or in-memory dict\n",
    "5. **Metrics**: Cache Hit Rate (target: >40%)\n",
    "   - Hit Rate = (Cache Hits) / (Total Requests)\n",

    "**Stampede Guard** (Dogpile Lock):\n",

    "1. **Token Count Check**: If < 50 tokens and no numbers → Simple Response\n",
    "2. **Keyword Matching**: \"Thank you\", \"Goodbye\" → Template Response\n",
    "3. **Embedding Similarity**: Compare query with FAQ embeddings\n",
    "   - Score > 0.9 → FAQ Template (no LLM)\n",
    "   - 0.7-0.9 → Small model (GPT-3.5)\n",
    "   - < 0.7 → Large model (GPT-4, Claude)\n",
    "4. **Continuous tuning**: log the chosen route + user feedback, and adjust thresholds.\n",
    "5. **LLM-based routing** should be a **last resort** when rules are uncertain or ambiguous.\n",
    "6. **Hybrid approach** works best:\n",
    "      1) Rules → 2) FAQ embedding match → 3) Small classifier → 4) LLM router (fallback)\n",

    "**Impact:**\n",

    "Before (all queries with GPT-4):\n",
