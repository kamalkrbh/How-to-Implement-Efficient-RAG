Remote Work Policy

TOPIC: Introduction and Benefits
This remote work policy establishes guidelines for employees who work from home or other remote locations. 
Our company recognizes the benefits of remote work for both employees and the organization, including 
increased productivity, improved work-life balance, and access to a broader talent pool. These advantages 
have become increasingly important in today's dynamic work environment.

TOPIC: Eligibility and Requirements
Remote work arrangements are available to employees who meet specific criteria. Eligible employees must 
demonstrate strong performance in their current role, possess excellent communication skills, and have 
access to appropriate technology and workspace. The eligibility criteria ensure that remote work benefits 
both the employee and the company. Performance reviews will be considered when evaluating eligibility.

TOPIC: Technology Infrastructure
Remote workers must have access to reliable internet connection with minimum speeds of 25 Mbps download 
and 5 Mbps upload. Employees are responsible for maintaining secure home networks and using company-approved 
VPN software for accessing internal systems. All devices must have up-to-date antivirus software and 
firewalls enabled. The IT department provides technical support for connectivity issues.

TOPIC: Communication and Collaboration
Remote employees are expected to maintain regular communication with their teams through video conferencing, 
instant messaging, and email. Daily check-ins with supervisors are required, and attendance at weekly team 
meetings is mandatory. Effective communication is critical for team cohesion. Employees should be responsive 
during core business hours and use appropriate channels for urgent matters.

TOPIC: Performance and Accountability
Remote work performance will be evaluated based on deliverables and outcomes rather than hours worked. 
Employees must meet all established deadlines and maintain the same quality standards as office-based workers.
Regular performance reviews will assess productivity, quality of work, and adherence to company policies.
Managers will provide feedback and support to ensure remote workers succeed in their roles.
